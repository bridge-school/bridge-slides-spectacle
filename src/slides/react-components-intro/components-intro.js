  `React is a component based library - meaning that it uses components to represents parts of the user view`,

  `In React, the way to write components representing html elements is to use JSX`,
  `JSX is an extension to how you can write javascript - it allows you to easily mix javascript/html`,
  `This is valuable because we often need to have logic mixed into our UI, and this is made easily with jsx`,
  `In other libraries/frameworks, often the HTML itself is 'enhanced' in React it's the javascript`,
